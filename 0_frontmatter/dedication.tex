\section{Data Source and Generative AI}

The source of the data for this research is the curated H\&E and HER2 IHC stain image patch pairs called the breast cancer immunohistochemical (BCI) dataset. BCI dataset can be downloaded from \href{https://bupt-ai-cz.github. io/BCI.}{https://bupt-ai-cz.github. io/BCI.} \parencite{Liu2022BCI:Pix2pix}. 

The use of generative AI, specifically ChatGPT-4o was to help with the literature review process by providing sources of information and summaries of papers. It was also leveraged to help with developing some of the code in this research. The areas where it was used has a comment at the top specifying the same. No generative AI was used to write any content of this dissertation.
