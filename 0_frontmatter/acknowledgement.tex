I would like to duly thank  Dr. Ciar´an Eising for his willingness to take a chance on me and take me under his fold. His willingness to be available for timely guidance was a boon. I would always know that I could reach out and count on him for any guidance, no matter the scope.

I would also like to thank Dr. James Brown for his constant words of encouragement and being a source of knowledge from the world of medical and biological sciences.

 My heartfelt gratitude to Dr. M´aire Lavelle for helping me out with underlying histopathological concepts was an absolute boon to this research. She also played a very important part in scoring generated IHC images even during inconvenient times which augmented the findings by many fold.

A big thank you to all three above co-supervisors for the willingness to take risks to take this research in a different direction than intended.

Finally, I would like to thank my family who are my constant source of support. I wouldn't be here without them.
